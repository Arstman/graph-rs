# Examples

To use the examples effectively, create a folder labeled: "example_files"
under the examples directory:
    
    ./examples/example_files
     
The examples have various places where the OAuth and Drive instances are stored
in JSON files to make it easier to use across multiple examples.

A good place to start is the rocket example: rocket_example.rs
